    <p class="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-gray-300">
      I utilize and build things that "just work".
      In terms of software development, I have experience with full-stack development and back-end APIs.
      Additionally, I prioritize clean, maintainable code and clear communication.
      As a seasoned Linux hobbyist, I dabble in system management and administration.
